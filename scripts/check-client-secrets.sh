# Fail the build if any server-only secret reference appears in the
# client-shipped output bundle.
#
# Background:
#   Next.js does NOT inline non-`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` env vars into the client
#   bundle — but a buggy import or a hard-coded string literal CAN leak
#   the env var name (or a typo of the value) into static JS. This guard
#   catches that at build time, before anything reaches a browser.
#
# Scope:
#   Greps `.next/static/**` (client-served) for server-only env names.
#   `.next/server/**` is intentionally NOT checked — server bundles
#   legitimately reference these vars.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/check-client-secrets.sh
#   Exit 0 = clean. Exit 1 = leak detected.
