    "What we collect",
    "Account and contact details; farmer and program registration facts; farm, plot, location, field-visit, photo and document evidence; approved communications; buyer, partner and staff records; and security, device and service logs.",
  ],
  [
    "Why we use it",
    "To operate approved agricultural programs, verify field and supply-chain evidence, communicate with participants, protect accounts, meet contractual and compliance duties, improve service reliability, and respond to support, privacy and security requests.",
  ],
  [
    "Who receives it",
    "Authorized Moedim staff and approved program participants receive only the access needed for their work. Infrastructure, authentication, communications, mapping and monitoring providers process limited information for Moedim under their applicable terms and reviewed controls. Buyer, certifier, auditor, partner or regulator disclosure is scoped to an approved purpose or legal requirement.",
  ],
  [
    "Moedim Field map services",
    "Google Maps may process map requests, device metadata, map interactions and SDK diagnostics to deliver and improve its maps. Mapbox processes the map and tile requests needed to render or download approved offline packs; optional Mapbox location telemetry is disabled in Moedim Field. Moedim does not use either mapping provider for advertising.",
  ],
  [
    "Moedim Field QR scanning",
    "Moedim Field uses Google ML Kit through the phone camera to scan approved QR codes. QR camera images and decoded values are processed on the device and are not sent to Google by ML Kit. The SDK may send limited app, device, installation, performance and usage information to Google for service diagnostics and analytics. Moedim does not use this information for advertising or tracking.",
  ],
  [
    "International processing",
    "Moedim uses service providers and teams in more than one country. Our internal privacy register records processing regions, transfer purposes, safeguard decisions, evidence and the next required review. Items that still need legal or provider confirmation remain visibly due rather than being presented as approved.",
  ],
  [
    "Retention",
    "We keep information only for the approved program, contractual, certification, safety, dispute, audit and legal periods that apply to it. Our internal register assigns a reviewable retention and deletion rule to each processing activity. Backups expire on their own controlled schedule.",
  ],
  [
    "Security",
    "We use role and tenant access controls, database row-level security, encrypted connections, private media storage, privileged-account MFA, audit trails, rate limits, monitoring and recurring control reviews. No system is risk-free, so we maintain an incident process and a public reporting route.",
